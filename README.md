# MinecraftDiscordLobbies
A Minecraft mod providing (poorly working) multiplayer over Discord.

## Download

### [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/discord-lobbies)

### [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/com/github/JnCrMx/MinecraftDiscordLobbies/1.16.4-SNAPSHOT/MinecraftDiscordLobbies-1.16.4-SNAPSHOT.jar)

*Note: This link will always point to the latest version built from the ``1.16.4`` branch.
It might take a bit until the download starts, because JitPack needs to build the latest version
if it was not built already. Wait a few minutes and open the link again or just wait a little.*

# Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with almost all other mods (unless they change network stuff a lot).
If you face issues with certain mods, please create an [issue](https://github.com/JnCrMx/MinecraftDiscordLobbies/issues/new).

# Problems

The connection is relatively slow. I am aware of this, 
but the limiting factor seems to be Discord and its network throughput and latency,
so I doubt that there is anything I can do about it.
If you have any ideas or concepts, feel free to create an issue or a pull request.
